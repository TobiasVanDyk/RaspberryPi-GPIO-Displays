Compiling new SPI LCD drivers for kernel 5.4:

    Edit the dts files for the type C and B revision 2 LCD displays from the swkim01 Github page, and change the 0 to 1 for both the reset and pendown GPIO's (reset-gpios = <&gpio 25 1>; pendown-gpio = <&gpio 17 1>;).
    Get a new version of dtc: git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git, and then do a make.
    Copy the new dts files into the dtc folder as well as the dtc.sh script from swkim01.
    Then do: sudo dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o waveshare35c.dtbo waveshare35c.dts. Ignore the spidev warning.
    The dtbo files can now be copied to the /boot/overlays/ folder - refer to the Waveshare folder for filenames.

Add the following lines in /boot/config.txt if they are not already there (change the waveshare35c to waveshare35b-v2 if required):

dtoverlay=waveshare35c:rotate=90
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=1
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_cvt=480 320 60 6 0 0 0
hdmi_drive=2
display_rotate=0

Make sure the line hdmi_cvt=480 320 60 6 0 0 0 has the equal sign, because the waveshare script is incorrect.

The folder swkim01 contain working config.txt and the dtbo files (as well as the dts source files).
