SDCard as supplied will not function with a 3v3 MCU. Replace the 3 x 1k series resistors R1, R2, R3 with 0 ohm resistors or a solder bridge. *A solder bridge has the additional advantage that it will also function as a slow-blow 200A fuse.*

Display as supplied is not in a Raspberry Pi compatible pin format. Details will be given below to connect it to a Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin GPIO connector.
